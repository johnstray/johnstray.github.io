### Pull Request Guidelines
- Create a fork of the 'development' branch first, and make sure it's up to date. This helps to prevent conflicts from occuring. 
- Only pull requests to the development branch will be accepted. This ensures that any new code can go through the review process before it reaches the master.
- All commits and pull requests MUST reference a related issue in the comments. If a related issue doesn't exist, please first create a new one.
- Code should follow common practises and the standards as set out in this [GetSimple Wiki](http://get-simple.info/wiki/getsimple_coding) article. This includes:
  - Indenting of code should consist of 4 spaces per indent, never tabs.
  - Each file should contain an empty line at the end, be UTF-8 encoded, and use UNIX based line-endings.
  - To make it easier for others to read and understand the code, it is recomended that you space out the code a bit more. An example is provided below:
    ```php
    if ( exampleFunction($variable) ) {
        $exploded = explode( $variable );
    } else {
        $imploded = implode( $variable );
    }
    
    // Note the spacing around brackets.
    // Curly braces should remain on the same line as the 'if' or 'else' statements
    ```
  - Changes that are cosmetic in nature and don't add anything substantial to the stability or functionality of the project will generally not be accepted.
  - Acceptance of pull requests is at the descretion of the project leader. All contributions to this repository will be appropriatly credited where possible.

This repository has the following branches, each with a specific purpose:
- `master` branch: The master contains all properly reviewed code and is ready for release version.
