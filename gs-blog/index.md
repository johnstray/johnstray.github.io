This version of GetSimple Blog is a fork of the original GS Blog 1.5 plugin by @mikeh and is now being actively developed and maintained by [John Stray](https://github.com/johnstray) and a [team of translators](/gs-blog/the-team.html). As many issues as I could find in the original version have been fixed now, plus a lot of functionality has been added with plenty more additions still to come.

_More information about this project, including what the future holds for it, the changelog from when we took over, the main documentation plus info on all the developers who have joined the project can be found on this website. Just use the links at the top of each page to navigate._

Translators are always welcome. If you speak a language that is not in the following list, then please feel free to contact the developers and become a translator today. I'd very much like to have this plugin translated to as many languages as possible.
